Soft-off power button for the Sovol SV04 3D printer, using an LED
pushbutton, a miniature 5V standby power supply module, and an ATtiny85
microcontroller.

The bracket in this tree holds a 16 mm (hole diameter) pushbutton.

Either common anode or common cathode LED buttons can be used; the
prebuilt firmware is configured for common anode (see
LED_COMMON_ANODE.)

It is not technically necessary to use an RGB pushbutton. A
one- or two-color pushbutton can be used just as well; the
microcontroller can even dim or pulse the LED(s) if desirable. The
prebuilt firmware uses the LEDs as follows:

	RED	- AC power available, power off
	GREEN	- Button is pressed
	BLUE	- Power on

As the circuit is very simple, I used a stripboard rather than waiting
for a custom PCB. However, a custom PCB would be smaller, and could be
made more robust.

The firmware uses avr-gcc and avr-libc; it does not require the
Arduino build environment or boot loader. Note that since all 6 I/O
pins are in use, the RESET DISABLE fuse needs to be programmed, and a
standalone (high voltage) programmer needs to be used. I recommend
socketing the MCU.

If you get a precrimped JST cable you apparently want to be careful
with the pinout (straight or crossover.) I found myself having bought
the latter. The pin that should be connected to the microcontroller
matches the one facing to the REAR of the SV04 mainboard connector J2
(yellow color on the adjacent wires.) Either kind of cable can be
used; simply rotate the connector on the stripboard appropriately.

Instead of using an SSR, you can opt to upgrade your power supply to
one which supports remote power control. However, most power supplies
are *active low* unlike the SSR, so in that case you will need to
change the polarity of the output in the firmware; you should also
remove resistor R4.
