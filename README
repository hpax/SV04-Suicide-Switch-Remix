Soft-off power button for the Sovol SV04 3D printer, using an LED
pushbutton, a miniature 5V standby power supply module, and an ATtiny85
microcontroller.

The bracket in this tree holds a 16 mm (hole diameter) pushbutton.

Either common anode or common cathode LED buttons can be used; the
prebuilt firmware is configured for common anode (see
LED_COMMON_ANODE.)

It is not technically necessary to use an RGB pushbutton. A
one- or two-color pushbutton can be used just as well; the
microcontroller can even dim or pulse the LED(s) if desirable. The
prebuilt firmware uses the LEDs as follows:

	RED	- AC power available, power off
	GREEN	- Button is pressed
	BLUE	- Power on

As the circuit is very simple, I used a stripboard rather than waiting
for a custom PCB. However, a custom PCB would be smaller, and could be
made more robust.

The firmware uses avr-gcc and avr-libc; it does not require the
Arduino build environment or boot loader. Note that since all 6 I/O
pins are in use, the RESET DISABLE fuse needs to be programmed, and a
standalone (high voltage) programmer needs to be used. I recommend
socketing the MCU.
